    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I have approx 2 years of Experience in web development.</p>
    <h3>E-Commerce Portal (2018-2019)</h3>
    <p>I have implemented e-commerce protal, where I have java based technology 'Servlet' and 'JSPs'.</p>
    <p>TO desion my web pages, I have used HTML and CSS and to make my web pages dynamic, I have used properties of Bootstrap.</p>
    <p>To connect java to backend I have used JDBC and used MySQL database client.</p>
    <p>In brief, it is basically an e-commerce portal where you can type an URL on a web browser, once you click enter you will be redirected to the homepage. Here, you can see all the list of products, there are some product categories as well. So, based on your interest, you can choose product category so it will display only those items. And if you like any, you can proceed to checkout and add it into a cart and then proceed to payment. Once you done with your payment, you will get a notification message to respected mobile number by saying <em>'Thank you for choosing us, you order <b>'Friskers yellow T-shirt'</b> has been successfully placed.</em> '
